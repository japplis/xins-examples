The petstore demo is a demo that tries to show you the advantages of using
XINS when developing an API or a Web application.

The total size of code specific to the application is 56 KB 
(Specifications, Java code, HTML, XSLT).

TinySQL has been used as JDBC database because of it's small size but if you
want to develop a similar application, I advise you to change it to HSQLDB
(http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net), H2 (http://www.h2database.com/) or 
Hibernate (http://www.hibernate.org/).

The application does not include an administrative part. If you want to 
administrate the store (reject customers, see the ordered items, see the
customers info, change password, remind password), use an SQL viewer such 
as iSQLViewer (http://www.isqlviewer.com/) to edit and look into the database.

The petstore demo uses the following features:
 - Custom calling convention for executing the XSLT transformation and 
   rendering HTML.
 - Authentication based on a loging/password with restricted pages.
 - AJAX demo in the Search page to give suggestions based on the first letters
   typed.
 - Redirection of pages.

Note that the calling convention (the xiff package) will be integrated in
XINS 1.5.0 and will also be available as a separate package for XINS 1.4.0.
